I designed this program during my fourth semester of college for Data Structures & Algorithms 2. The goal was to create a program that can loads user-selected images of circuit boards and search them for components. The search should be based on the users required parameters and should highlight each present component upon completion. The program should then present the user with relevant data regarding the search (number of components present, component size, etc.).
